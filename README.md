Within this repository, we have meticulously documented the methodologies and techniques employed for data gathering and data manipulation, facilitating the construction of a comprehensive master data repository. The development of a master data repository plays a pivotal role in various domains, enabling organizations to centralize and consolidate data from disparate sources for enhanced data management and analysis.

We also presented a comprehensive demonstration on the identification and resolution of collinearity issues. Collinearity refers to the presence of strong linear relationships between predictor variables, which can pose challenges in statistical modeling and analysis. Our repository aims to provide a clear understanding of the techniques and methodologies employed to detect and address collinearity effectively.

Subsequently, our focus shifted towards addressing the issue of null values within datasets by leveraging various imputation methods accessible in the R programming language. Null values, also known as missing data, can significantly hinder data analysis and modeling endeavors. Therefore, our repository offers comprehensive insights into effective strategies for handling these missing values.
